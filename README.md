## 💡 Tips & Best Practices Learned:

1. Use **12+ characters** in your password.
2. Combine **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols**.
3. Avoid common words or patterns (like "123456", "password", etc.).
4. Use **passphrases** like `ILove$Cyber@2025` for both strength and memorability.
5. Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** whenever possible.
6. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple sites.
7. Consider using a **password manager** to store strong, unique passwords.

## 🛡️ Common Password Attacks:

### 🔸 Brute Force Attack:
An attacker tries every possible combination to guess your password. Longer and complex passwords increase the time it takes drastically.

### 🔸 Dictionary Attack:
A method where attackers use a list of common passwords and phrases. Simple and commonly used passwords are especially vulnerable.

## 📁 Files Included:
- `README.md` (this file)
- `/screenshots/` folder containing nothing

## ✅ Conclusion:
Creating strong passwords significantly improves security. Even small changes (like adding symbols or increasing length) can drastically change how long it would take to crack a password.
